Scrape business information from yellowpages.com


[x] A short description. (scrape business information from yellowpages.com and present info to the user)
<br />
[x] Install instructions. (included in the readme.md file)
<br />
[x] A contributor's guide. (included in the readme.md file)
<br />
[x] A link to the liscense for your code. (included in the readme.md file)
<br />
[x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (bizinfo calls the CLI interface)
<br />
[x] Pull data from an external source (pulls data from the yellowpages.com website)
<br />
[x] Implement both list and detail views. The data provided must go at least one level deep, generally by showing the user a list of available data and then being able to drill down into a specific item (pulls a list of businesses via a search term. user makes selection for additional details about the business)
<br />
[x] The application is pretty DRY. (used loops to avoid repetition)
<br />
[x] Basic control flow - how "if" statements work (many conditional statements are included)
<br />
[x] Variable scopes - method, instance and class (class and instance variables are included)
<br />
[x] Object instantiation - #new (and possibly #initialize) (business objects are created from the data scraped from yellowpages.com)
<br />
[x] The meaning of the "self" keyword (use the self keyword when adding instance of the Business class to the class variable)
<br />
[x] Method types - class vs. instance methods (use both class and instance methods)
<br />
[x] Method return types - knowing what methods return (consideration was made when they were created.)
<br />
[x] Iterating through collections - at least using #each with a block (iteration was used several times)
